/*This is my report on the Single vs Multithreaded summing algorithms. In comparison both the single and multithreaded
both seemed to be about the same speed. Even with mutliple runs of the single and multithreaded summing functions. Both
of them seemed to take around the same amount of time. I did notice on occasion that the single threaded program took 
very marginally longer than the multithreaded and that the multithreaded program sometimes took a marginal amount of time
less than it's average time. But in general it seems that they're about the same speed. */
